# Which control panel do I have?

I authored [this accessible end-user guide](https://github.com/kaefoody/kaefoody.github.io/blob/main/writing_samples/Electrical_control_panels/Electrical_control_panel_guide.md) for an electronics manufacturing company because their clients couldn't identify or locate their product's model number or basic features.

Their product (**high-voltage electrical control panels**) was simply too technical and intimidating for their end-users (**average homeowners**) to approach. Of course, their support staff needed these basic pieces of information before they could even begin to troubleshoot. This guide safely helps users find these details before they even pick up the phone. 

As a result, their end-users have a more productive and pleasant support experience, and their support staff have gained back valuable time spent on these calls.
