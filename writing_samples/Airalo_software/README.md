## What is Airalo?

Airalo's software allows you to purchase and install a virtual SIM card (or "eSIM") on your mobile device. 

This means you can **avoid expensive roaming fees** and **connect to affordable celluar data** the second you land in a new country â€” all from the convenience of your phone.



## Airalo's Documentation

Unfortunately, Airalo's documentation is difficult to follow. 

I'm a frequent Airalo user myself, but often struggle to install or activate my eSIM correctly following their instructions. I've incurred expensive roaming fees because of knowledge gaps in their documentation. 

I believe in Airalo's vision to provide this revolutionary service to travelers like myself, so I took it upon myself to improve some of their documentation.



####  How I revised Airalo's [original](https://www.airalo.com/help/getting-started-with-airalo/how-can-i-install-my-esim-via-direct-installation-on-my-ios-device) installation guide:

| **Problem**                                                  | **Old UX**                                                   | **My Revisions**                                             | **New UX**                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instructions were cluttered with full-sized iPhone screenshots | Users couldn't quickly scan for key info; poor accessibility because there's no alt-text for screen readers | Replaced screenshots with concise steps, button indicators, and paths | Draws the user's eye back to the steps; makes the document more readable and accessible |
| Instructions didn't explain how to disable cellular data from original eSIM | Users incurred pricey roaming cellular data fees             | Addressed these knowledge gaps with additional steps         | Users save money using Airalo's product as intended          |
| In-app instructions dissapear as soon as users start installing their eSIM | Users couldn't follow Airalo's instructions during the installation process | Provide a link to a concise version of the guide before the installation process | Users can follow instructions in a separate browser window   |
