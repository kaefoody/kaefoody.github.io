## What is Airalo?

Airalo's software allows travelers to purchase and install a virtual SIM card (*or "eSIM"*) on their mobile device. Airalo gives travelers the freedom to connect to affordable celluar data the moment they land--all from the convenience of their phone.

Unfortunately, Airalo's documentation can be difficult to follow. I'm a frequent Airalo user myself, but often struggle to install or activate my eSIM correctly using their instructions. I've incurred a hefty amount of travel pass fees because of knowledge gaps in their documentation.

I identified a few key weaknesses in Airalo's installation guide:

1. It was cluttered with full-sized iPhone screenshots that made this document difficult for users to scan. 
2. It didn't include instructions (or even a link to another reference page) for how to disable your previous eSIM. This means users would accidentally incur roaming cellular data fees on their primary plan.
