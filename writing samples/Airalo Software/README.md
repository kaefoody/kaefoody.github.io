## What is Airalo?

Airalo's software allows travelers to purchase and install a virtual SIM card (*or "eSIM"*) on their mobile device. This means you can connect to affordable celluar data the moment you land â€” all from the convenience of your phone.

Unfortunately, Airalo's documentation can be difficult to follow. I'm a frequent Airalo user myself, but often struggle to install or activate my eSIM correctly following their instructions. I've incurred expensive travel pass fees because of knowledge gaps in their documentation.

I identified and revised a few key weaknesses in Airalo's installation guide:

| **Problem** | **Old UX** | **My revisions** | **New UX** |
| :---------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :--------: |
| Instructions were cluttered with full-sized iPhone screenshots | Difficult for users to scan | I cropped the screenshots to take up less space in the document | Draws the reader's eye back to the steps and makes document more readable.|
| Instructions didn't explain (or link to another reference page) how to disable cellular data your previous eSIM | Users could accidentally incur pricey roaming cellular data fees | I addressed these knowledge gaps | Users save money using Airalo's product as intended |
